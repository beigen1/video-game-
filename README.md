Lab 1 Project Overview
This project is a simple 2D space scene created in Godot. The main goal was to practice building and organizing scenes while working with sprite images. The scene takes place in space and includes a spaceship traveling through a background filled with multiple aliens.

Project Requirements Completed
- Created a main scene
- Used two different sprite images 
- Built a separate alien scene and instanced it multiple times throughout the main scene
- Uploaded the full Godot project to GitHub with this README file

What I Learned
While working on this project, I learned how to import images into Godot and apply them to Sprite2D nodes. I also got more comfortable creating separate scenes and then instancing them multiple times inside a main scene. Another thing I learned was how to organize project folders and upload a full game project to GitHub (hopefully done right). 

Questions / Reflections
One thing I’m still curious about is how developers automatically place multiple instances (like enemies or objects) instead of positioning each one manually. I’m also interested in learning how collisions or movement would be added to make the scene more interactive in the future.
